Only 60% of death records are submitted to NCHS within 10 days of the date of death, and completeness varies by jurisdiction. Weighted numbers of deaths are 20% or more higher than the control counts. Data may be less complete than in previous years, or weights may be too high in states where timeliness of provisional data has improved."
